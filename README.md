Module for exploring cloud computing and the use of parallelisation by processing big data

This module made use of the Google Cloud Platform where we were given tokens to use cluster computing. The code we were running on this cloud computing was to simulate the processing of big data in a server farm - we were provided with the text from 10,000 books and were tasked with outputing the number of occurances of each word, and to output the list of words alphabetically, ignoring a certain set of words.

This coursework was written in Java and made us of the Google Cloud Platform, I recieved a 1st for it.
